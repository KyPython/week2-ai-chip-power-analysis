# Week 2: AI Chip Power Analysis & Thermal Management

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes **power consumption** and **thermal requirements** for different AI hardware accelerators. It demonstrates the critical tradeoffs between power efficiency, performance, and thermal management in modern AI chips.

Part of my **Computer Engineering + AI/ML Weekly Review** learning series.

## 🔥 Why This Matters

Real AI chips face brutal tradeoffs:
- **Mobile chips** prioritize efficiency (GOPS/Watt) - must run on batteries
- **Desktop GPUs** balance power and performance - have active cooling
- **Data center chips** maximize throughput - have unlimited power but cooling costs millions

Understanding these hardware constraints is essential for designing AI systems that actually work in the real world.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **Circuit Analysis** - Ohm's Law, power calculations
- **Thermal Physics** - Heat dissipation and cooling analysis
- **AI Hardware Architecture** - Understanding MAC units, process nodes, frequency scaling

## 📊 What This Program Does

The program analyzes three different AI accelerator architectures:

1. **Mobile AI Accelerator** (5nm, 1.0 GHz)
2. **Desktop GPU** (7nm, 2.0 GHz)
3. **Data Center TPU** (7nm, 1.5 GHz)

For each architecture, it calculates:
- Dynamic power consumption (P = α × C × V² × f)
- Static power (leakage current)
- Total chip power
- Thermal characteristics with different cooling solutions
- Performance (GFLOPS)
- Power efficiency (GOPS/Watt)

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/week2-ai-chip-power-analysis.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd week2-ai-chip-power-analysis

# Run the analysis
python ai_chip_power_analysis.py
```

## 📈 Key Results

### Power Consumption
- **Mobile**: 0.83W - Excellent for battery-powered devices
- **Desktop GPU**: 1.66W - Higher power for better performance
- **Data Center TPU**: 1.25W - Balanced for server environments

### Thermal Management
All architectures tested with three cooling solutions:
- ✅ **Passive heatsink** - All chips stay cool (< 42°C)
- ✅ **Active cooling (fan)** - Even better (~30°C)
- ✅ **Liquid cooling** - Overkill for these examples, but necessary for full-scale chips

### Performance
- **Mobile**: 128 GFLOPS with lowest power
- **Desktop**: 256 GFLOPS with highest power
- **Data Center**: 192 GFLOPS balanced throughput

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Mobile chips prioritize efficiency** - Must run on limited battery power
2. **Desktop GPUs balance power and performance** - Have active cooling available
3. **Data center chips maximize throughput** - Power is available but cooling is expensive
4. **Thermal management is critical for all** - Heat kills chips
5. **Process node affects both power and performance** - Smaller nodes = more efficient

## 🎓 What I Learned

### Hardware Fundamentals
- Ohm's Law and power calculations
- Dynamic vs static power consumption
- Thermal resistance and heat dissipation
- Process node technology (5nm vs 7nm)

### AI Hardware Architecture
- Why AI chips need specialized architectures
- MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) units as the building block
- How frequency scaling affects power consumption (quadratic relationship!)
- Real-world cooling constraints

### Engineering Tradeoffs
- No "perfect" chip - always trading off power, performance, and cost
- Mobile requires efficiency > Desktop requires performance > Data center requires throughput
- Thermal management can cost more than the chip itself in data centers
